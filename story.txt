Todd Howard is the spokeman for bethesda games but what people really don't
 know is that he is an alien from another world. Todd Howard is known for one
 thing, lots of Skyrim for every console that ever exists, what people don't
 know though is Skyrim is actually brainwashing the human population to
 allow for an alien invasion by the shapeshifting spaghetti
 people from Sirius B. Todd Howard thought that his people were
 immune to Skyrim but after its release in VR they all started to
 fall to the plague. The only way for Todd to save his people is to
 release a great triple A title that is better than skyrim.
 Fallout 76 failed and more and more are looking at Todd as a
 failure and a money grub but the hopes of a new and better elder
 scrolls game (eso doesnt count) that will dethrone skyrim and
 save the shapeshifting speghetti people forever.

though todd Howard is a anlien, lots of people love him.

The elder scrolls game notwithstanding, a new AAA game was on the horizon. 
Artifact. The fact that the game was based on another company's IP was not
an obstacle for Godd Howard. He had a plan: infiltrate Blizzard, steal the 
source code, save humanity. After all, we do have phones.

Godd Howard's plan worked perfectly. He infiltrated Blizzard by disguising 
himself as a Blizzard employee using his alien technology, the Character 
Customization Chamber. Now all he needs to do is get back to his home
 planet, Spaghetteron.
