Todd Howard is the spokeman for bethesda games but what people really don't know is that he is an alien from another world. Todd Howard is known for one thing, lots of Skyrim for every console that ever exists, what people don't know though is Skyrim is actually brainwashing the human population to allow for an alien invasion by the shapeshifting spaghetti people from Sirius B. Todd Howard thought that his people were immune to Skyrim but after its release in VR they all started to fall to the plague. The only way for Todd to save his people is to release a great triple A title that is better than skyrim. Fallout 76 failed and more and more are looking at Todd as a failure and a money grub but the hopes of a new and better elder scrolls game (eso doesnt count) that will dethrone skyrim and save the shapeshifting speghetti people forever.
though todd Howard is a anlien, lots of people love him.
